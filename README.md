# Alexa-Review-Sentimental-Analysis

## Project overflow

🛠️ Leveraging the Amazon Alexa customer reviews dataset available on Kaggle, we developed a sentiment classification model that categorizes input text as positive or negative. This model serves as a valuable tool for analyzing customer opinions and improving product quality based on user feedback.

📝 Our data preparation phase involved sophisticated text preprocessing techniques. We leveraged the **NLTK** library to perform **lemmatization**, reducing words to their base forms. Additionally, we employed vectorization to transform text into numerical features and utilized the **bag-of-words model** to capture term frequencies. This multi-faceted approach allowed us to extract meaningful features from the raw text reviews

📈 After training 𝐑𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭, **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐬, 𝐗𝐆𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭, **Multilayer perceptron** and **Multinomial Naive bayes** models with optimal hyperparamter, we rigorously evaluated their performance with 𝐀𝐔𝐂-𝐑𝐎𝐂 𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬.

🎉 Excited to announce that our model boasts an impressive 𝟗3% 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞, providing companies with actionable insights for product development and enhancing overall user experience.
